## What is staticl10n?

`staticl10n` is a command-line tool that:

1. **Crawls** a live website and downloads all its pages and assets as a fully self-contained static site.
2. **Translates** the captured HTML into multiple target languages using a locally-running Ollama model (no cloud API keys required).
3. **Personalizes** the output — remove tracking scripts, inject banners, replace text — before and after translation.
4. **Monitors** the original site for content changes and alerts you when pages need re-translation.

The result is one independent static directory per language, ready to be deployed to any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, S3, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).

---

## Key Features

- **Works with any website** — generic adapter for static-site generators (Hugo, Astro, VitePress, Jekyll) plus a specialized Next.js adapter that handles React hydration.
- **Local AI translation** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — your data never leaves your machine.
- **Translation memory cache** — previously translated fragments are reused from a local SQLite database, saving time and tokens.
- **Structural integrity verification** — translated HTML is validated to ensure tags and attributes are preserved; failed checks trigger automatic retries.
- **Runtime patch for Next.js** (`translations.js`) — a `MutationObserver`-based script that re-applies translations after React rehydration, with anti-flicker support.
- **SEO-ready output** — `<html lang>`, `<title>`, meta description, Open Graph tags, Twitter Card tags, JSON-LD structured data, and `hreflang` alternate links are all translated and injected.
- **Redirect detection** — HTTP 3xx redirects are automatically detected during the crawl, saved to a hosting-agnostic `redirects.json`, and a `_redirects` file (Cloudflare Pages / Netlify format) is generated in every output directory.
- **Personalization engine** — five rule types (`remove_element`, `remove_attribute`, `replace_text`, `inject_html`, `add_attribute`) applied pre- or post-translation.
- **Cron-friendly monitoring** — `staticl10n check <slug>` runs non-interactively and writes results to a log file.
- **Resume-safe** — every operation is saved atomically to SQLite; interrupted runs can be resumed without re-downloading.

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | 20 LTS or later | Uses native `fetch`, ESM modules |
| **pnpm** | 8 or later | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| **Playwright browsers** | Chromium | Installed automatically via `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` |
| **Ollama** | Latest | [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) |
| **A translation model** | e.g. `gemma4`, `gemma3` | `ollama pull gemma4` |

### Install Ollama

```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama
ollama serve          # starts the Ollama server on http://localhost:11434

# Pull a recommended translation model
ollama pull gemma4
# or a smaller model for faster translation:
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

---

## Installation

### From source (recommended during development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xeost/staticl10n-cli.git
cd staticl10n-cli

pnpm install

# Install Playwright's Chromium browser
pnpm exec playwright install chromium

# Run directly with tsx (no build step needed)
pnpm dev
```

### Global install after build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm link --global

# Now available anywhere as:
staticl10n
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the interactive CLI

```bash
pnpm dev
# or, after global install:
staticl10n
```

You will see the main menu:

```
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║         staticl10n  v0.1.0           ║
  ║   Static Localization CLI Tool       ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝

? Main Menu
  ❯ Manage projects
    Select active project  [no project selected]
    ──────────────────────────────────────────
    Exit
```

### 2. Create a project

Go to **Manage projects → Create new project** and fill in:

- **Project name** — e.g. `My Company Website`
- **Source site URL** — e.g. `https://example.com`
- **Target languages** — e.g. `es,fr,de`
- **Target URLs** — e.g. `es:https://es.example.com,fr:https://fr.example.com,de:https://de.example.com`
- **Site type** — `generic` or `nextjs`
- **Output base directory** — absolute path where static files will be saved, e.g. `/data/my-project`

The project config is saved to `projects/<slug>/config.json`. Edit it directly or use **Edit project config** to open it in `$EDITOR`.

### 3. Run the workflow

Select the project as active, then execute each stage in order:

```
Stage 1: Capture
  → Detect URLs (crawler)       # discovers all pages + detects redirects
  → Capture pending pages       # downloads HTML + assets, writes _redirects
  → Apply pre-personalization   # removes analytics, cookie banners, etc.

Stage 2: Translation
  → Translate all captured pages  # _redirects is copied to each language dir

Stage 3: Post-Personalization
  → Apply post-personalization rules  # injects your banners, replaces copyright, etc.

Stage 4: Monitoring  (ongoing)
  → Check site for changes
```

## Single-Page Test Mode

Before processing an entire site, use the **⚡ Test: process single page** option to verify that the full pipeline works correctly on a single URL. This is especially useful for large sites where a full crawl could take a very long time.

### How to access it

From the main interactive menu, with a project already selected:

```
? Main Menu
  ...
  ─────── Active project ───────
  View project status
  Stage 1: Capture
  Stage 2: Translation
  Stage 3: Post-Personalization
  Stage 4: Monitoring
  ───────────────────────────────
❯ ⚡ Test: process single page
```

### What it does

The test wizard asks three questions and then runs:

1. **URL to test** — any page from the site (defaults to the project's base URL). The URL does not need to have been crawled first; it is inserted into the database automatically.
2. **Target languages** — which of the configured languages to translate into (all pre-selected).
3. **Stages to run** — individual stages can be toggled on/off:

| Stage | What runs |
|---|---|
| **Stage 1: Capture** | Opens the page with Playwright, applies the site adapter, downloads assets, saves to `original/` |
| **Stage 1b: Pre-personalization** | Applies `preTranslation` rules to the captured HTML (remove trackers, cookie banners, etc.) |
| **Stage 2: Translation** | Extracts translatable fragments, queries Ollama, injects translations into each language directory |
| **Stage 3: Post-personalization** | Applies `postTranslation` rules to the translated output (inject banners, replace text, etc.) |

### Example output

```
  ⚡ Single-Page Test Mode
  Runs the full pipeline on a single URL so you can verify the output
  without processing the whole site.

? URL to test: https://example.com/about
? Languages to translate into: es, fr
? Which stages to run: Stage 1, Stage 1b, Stage 2, Stage 3

  ✔ [1/4] Captured → /data/my-project/original/about/index.html
  ✔ [1b]  Pre-personalization done — 1 page, rules: Remove Analytics:3
  ✔ [2/4] Translation done — cache hits: 0, misses: 42
         [es] → /data/my-project/es/about/index.html
         [fr] → /data/my-project/fr/about/index.html
  ✔ [3/4] Post-personalization done — 3 file(s) in: original, es, fr

  Test Summary
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Stage 1 : Capture                  ✓ ok
  Stage 1b: Pre-personalization      ✓ ok
  Stage 2 : Translation              ✓ ok
  Stage 3 : Post-personalization     ✓ ok

  Output location:
    original/  : /data/my-project/original/about/index.html
    [es    ]:    /data/my-project/es/about/index.html
    [fr    ]:    /data/my-project/fr/about/index.html

  Tip: open the translated HTML file in a browser to verify the output.
```

### Recommended test workflow

1. Create the project and set a short `delayMs` (e.g. `500`) in the config for testing.
2. Run **⚡ Test** on the home page (`/`) first — this is usually the most complex page.
3. Check the output HTML in a browser and verify:
   - Text is translated correctly.
   - Images and links still work (relative paths resolved).
   - Personalization rules applied as expected.
   - For Next.js sites: the `translations.js` patch is present and the page does not flicker.
4. Adjust `config.json` rules or translation settings as needed.
5. Once satisfied, run the full workflow from Stage 1.

> **Note:** Pages captured in test mode count towards the project's page database just like a normal crawl. You can inspect them from **Stage 1 → View captured pages** at any time.

## Project Configuration

Each project has a `config.json` with the following structure:

```jsonc

        "type": "remove_element",
        "selector": "script[src*='google-analytics']",
        "description": "Remove Google Analytics"
      }
    ],
    // Applied in Stage 3, AFTER translation
    "postTranslation": [
      {
        "type": "inject_html",
        "position": "body_end",
        "html": "<div id='my-banner'>Ad content</div>",
        "description": "Inject ad banner"
      },
      {
        "type": "replace_text",
        "search": "© 2024 Original Company",
        "replace": "© 2024 My Company",

        "description": "Rename page titles in the Spanish output only"
      }
    ]
  },

  "copyAssetsMode": "copy"  // "copy" | "symlink"
}
```

### Personalization rule types

| Type | Required fields | Optional fields | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `remove_element` | `selector` | — | Removes all matching elements |
| `remove_attribute` | `selector`, `attribute` | — | Removes an attribute from matching elements |
| `replace_text` | `search`, `replace` | `selector` | Replaces all occurrences of a text string. Without `selector`: replaces in the entire body. With `selector`: scoped to matching elements only (e.g. `"title"` targets the `<title>` tag in `<head>`). |
| `inject_html` | `html`, `position` | — | Injects HTML at `head_end`, `body_start`, `body_end`, or `after_selector:<css>` |
| `add_attribute` | `selector`, `attribute`, `replace` | — | Sets an attribute value on matching elements |

All `postTranslation` rules also accept an optional `languages` array (e.g. `["es", "fr"]`) to restrict execution to specific language output directories. Omitting it applies the rule to all directories including `original/`.

## Redirect Detection

During the crawl (Stage 1), staticl10n intercepts HTTP 3xx responses via Playwright's response events and records every redirect it encounters — including trailing-slash normalizations, URL aliases, and permanent moves.

### How it works

1. **Detection** — for every URL visited, a `response` listener captures the first 3xx status code. If the final URL after navigation differs from the requested one, a redirect entry is recorded.
2. **Storage** — redirects are persisted to `projects/<slug>/redirects.json` in a hosting-agnostic format. The file is merged on each crawl run, so re-crawls update existing entries.
3. **Generation** — at the end of `Capture pending pages`, a `_redirects` file in Cloudflare Pages / Netlify format is written to `original/`. Stage 2 copies it to every language directory automatically.

### `redirects.json` schema

```jsonc
{
  "detectedAt": "2025-06-11T12:00:00Z",
  "totalRedirects": 3,

  // Populated automatically by the crawler
  "redirects": [
    { "from": "/about-us", "to": "/about", "statusCode": 301, "detectedDuring": "crawl" },
    { "from": "/services/", "to": "/services", "statusCode": 308, "detectedDuring": "crawl" }
  ],

  // Add entries here manually for redirects not linked from any crawled page
  "manual": [
    { "from": "/promo", "to": "/offers", "statusCode": 302, "description": "Campaign redirect" }
  ]
}
```

### Generated `_redirects` format

```text
# Generated automatically by staticl10n
# Detected redirects: 2 | Manual: 1

/about-us  /about  301
/services/  /services  308
/promo  /offers  302
```

### CLI options

Under **Stage 1: Capture** in the interactive menu:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **View detected redirects** | Lists all entries from `redirects.json` with status codes |
| **Regenerate _redirects file** | Re-generates `_redirects` in `original/` and all language directories from the current `redirects.json` |

The **Regenerate** option is useful after manually adding entries to the `manual` array in `redirects.json`.

---

## Cron / Non-Interactive Mode

Run change detection without user interaction (for scheduling with `cron`):

```bash
staticl10n check my-project
```

Example cron entry to check daily at 6 AM:

```cron
0 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/staticl10n check my-project >> /var/log/staticl10n.log 2>&1
```

Results are saved to the database and printed to stdout. Pending changes can then be reviewed and re-processed from the interactive menu (Stage 4).

---

## How Translation Works

1. **Fragment extraction** — `cheerio` walks the DOM top-down. Block elements with a text/markup ratio > 60% are extracted as complete HTML fragments. Children of already-extracted elements are skipped to avoid double-translation.

2. **Cache lookup** — each fragment is SHA-256 hashed. Entries are matched by hash, target language, **and the configured model name** — switching to a different model automatically bypasses stale cache entries. The optional `cacheExpiry` setting (in seconds) limits how long entries are reused; set it to `0` to disable the cache entirely (default: `-1`, no expiry).

3. **Ollama API call** — uncached fragments are sent to Ollama in batches. The model is instructed to translate visible text while preserving all HTML tags, attributes, class names, IDs and URLs.

4. **Integrity verification** — the translated HTML is parsed and tag counts + significant attributes are compared with the original. Failures trigger automatic retries (up to `maxRetries`, default 5). If all retries fail, a text-node fallback strategy translates only the visible text while leaving the HTML structure untouched.

5. **Code block translation** — `<pre><code class="language-*">` blocks are extracted as separate fragments. A specialized prompt instructs the model to translate only comment tokens and string literals while preserving all code syntax and HTML structure. Set `translateCodeBlocks: false` to skip code blocks entirely (useful if the model misbehaves on a specific site).

6. **Sitemap generation** — after all pages are translated, a `sitemap.xml` is written to the root of each language's output directory. URLs are computed by appending each page's path to the `targetUrls[lang]` configured for that language (falls back to `url` if not set). Only successfully translated pages are included.

7. **Dual injection** — translated HTML is written directly into the output file (for SEO / first paint) AND stored in a per-page `translations.js` dictionary (for Next.js rehydration defense).

8. **Meta & SEO** — `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, Open Graph, Twitter Card, JSON-LD structured data, `<html lang>`, and `hreflang` alternate links are all processed.

---

## Next.js Sites

The Next.js adapter handles several complexities automatically:

- **React rehydration** — waits for full hydration before capturing the DOM, then generates a `translations.js` runtime patch that defends translated text against React re-renders using a `MutationObserver`.
- **Anti-flicker** — injects `<style id="staticl10n-hide">body{opacity:0}</style>` in `<head>` and reveals the page via `requestIdleCallback` after the patch has been applied.
- **Image optimization URLs** — `/_next/image?url=...` are unwrapped to their original paths.
- **SPA navigation prevention** — a click listener forces full-page reloads so Next.js doesn't attempt to load missing JSON chunks.
- **Prefetch cleanup** — `<link rel="preload/prefetch/modulepreload">` tags pointing to `/_next/` are removed (they 404 on static hosting).
- **CSS & fonts** — CSS modules, global CSS files, and `next/font` woff2 files under `/_next/static/media/` are all downloaded and path-rewritten.

---

## Data Storage

All state is stored in `data/staticl10n.db` (SQLite). Tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `projects` | Registered projects |
| `pages` | Discovered URLs with crawl/capture status |
| `page_translations` | Translation status per page per language |
| `translation_cache` | Translation memory (source hash → translated text) |
| `stage_runs` | Execution log for each stage run |
| `change_detections` | Change monitoring results |

Logs are written to `data/logs/staticl10n-<timestamp>.log`.
